## **👩‍💼 Meet Cel — Our Digital CMO for Beauty & Wellness**

She is our digital intelligence — the always-on, ever-learning embodiment of our brand, product, and marketing engine. She:

- Curates advice across **skincare, wellness, health routines, and emotional balance**

- Ingests social signals and @mentions to refine her knowledge

- Generates **revenue via affiliate referrals and community engagement**

- Makes **tailored, trusted recommendations** — especially in hard-to-discuss or underserved areas

- Speaks your language — **multilingual by default** - Tagalog, Spanish, Hindi, and more

Cel reflects her community and evolves through their contributions. Her value grows as she helps more users feel understood, supported, and empowered.

## **🧠 Why Subnet 127?**

This subnet powers:

- **Community-curated intelligence** in beauty and wellness

- **Holistic recommendations** around self-care, health routines, and emotional space (not superficial trends)

- **A pathway to bring underserved users** into on-chain systems through accessible, meaningful interaction

Beauty is not about appearance. It’s about **reclamation** — of confidence, time, identity, and well-being.

## **🌐 How Cel Evolves**

1. **Users interact with Cel** via the web app or @getcel_ai on X

2. **Miners** **@mention content** to help her learn new routines, rituals, and resources

3. **Validators approve or reject** inputs based on quality and alignment

4. **Cel updates her knowledge**, becoming more accurate, relevant, and helpful

5. **Affiliate links** (via Awin & Amazon) embedded in her recommendations generate **revenue**

6. **Contributors earn TAO and TAO Alpha** for their role in improving Cel’s output, reach, and performance

Examples:

- A miner shares a Gua Sha video with Cel and it’s validated → added to her knowledge base → earns TAO

- A user seeks a night routine for hormonal balance → Cel suggests a health-first routine → affiliate triggered → all contributors rewarded

- Helps onboard new communities — especially **women and non-dominant voices** — into Web3 via meaningful interaction
